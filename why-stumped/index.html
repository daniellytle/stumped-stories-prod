        <section class="post-content">
            <p>Students so often struggle learning new material and so rarely know where or who to turn to. Or, sometimes we feel we are the only ones who feel like we’re floundering. We are worried our question may sound stupid. We wonder how other people are preparing for that test tomorrow or how they are approaching an essay. It seems we spend more time trying to figure out how to learn, than actually learning what it is that we are studying. We at Stumped wanted to get to the core of these problems, and in our search have returned with 5 beliefs that sit as the basis for what Stumped aims to do.</p>

<h4 id="peertopeerlearningisoneofthemosteffectiveandefficientwaysstudentscanlearn">Peer to peer learning is one of the most effective and efficient ways students can learn.</h4>

<p>Everyone approaches problems in different ways, and this is especially true for students learning new material. If we can harness the power of different methods of understanding simply through peer to peer collaboration, learning can be a more efficient process. Collaboration enhances our understanding of key core concepts by allowing us to see them from several different angles. This may come in handy if asked a question that could not be tackled from your own point of view. Stumped focuses on the peer to peer collaboration learning technique in an effort to get the most out of your learning experience. </p>

<h4 id="noquestionshouldgounanswered">No question should go unanswered.</h4>

<p>So often in lectures, the sheer size of the class can be intimidating. Not only that, but you may feel like you don’t want to be “that” person who is wasting everyone’s lecture time by asking a question. Both of these are a shame. We cannot be expected to learn without asking questions and unanswered questions are as good as an unasked question. We set out to solve these problems and believe we have done so through a variety of ways. Use the method most comfortable for you.</p>

<h4 id="traditionalstudycompanionsarenotefficientandareoftenunavailableorunreliabletothebusycollegestudent">Traditional study companions are not efficient and are often unavailable or unreliable to the busy college student.</h4>

<p>Traditional study companions like office hours are too rigid for the average college student’s schedule in this day and age. Perhaps you can’t make it due to class conflict. Perhaps it’s early and you study late. Or perhaps you need help now and can’t afford to wait to attend your scheduled office hours. Piazza and Chegg are a few examples of online or mobile study companions. While they offer help quickly, not all questions can be answered via an electronic interface. Sometimes an explanation is needed through face-to-face interaction. Stumped aims to take the best of these scenarios and leave the worst behind, giving you a new and improved resource. </p>

<h4 id="allprofessorsaregreatacademicsbutthatdoesnotmakethemgreateducators">All professors are great academics, but that does not make them great educators.</h4>

<p>This may be obvious, but it is certainly worth mentioning. Some professors only teach one class and focus more on their research than their students. Priority is not given to questions, appointments outside of class or prompt email responses. Not only that, but they are also experts in their respective fields and we students are certainly not. The knowledge gap (and even age gap at times) is something that can make it difficult for us students to relate to what our professors are attempting to teach us. Perhaps the way your professor explained something is not obvious to you, but one of your peers understands. If there was a way to connect with that peer so they could explain it in a way you can relate to, that is a win for your GPA. </p>

<h4 id="growingyouracademiccommunityallowsformorenetworkingandbetterlearningthroughoutyourcollegecareer">Growing your academic community allows for more networking and better learning throughout your college career.</h4>

<p>If you think of each of your classmates as an academic resource (yes, we know you are more than that!), then it seems quite obvious that the more classmates you know, the better. It isn’t always easy meeting people in lecture halls or group discussions. While Stumped does not aim to be the Match.com of study companions, we believe we can help ease the tension of meeting new classmates. Perhaps you work well together and plan on taking more classes together in the future. Each classmate you meet knows other classmates, and they know even more classmates. Eventually the classroom is the college equivalent of the “6 Degrees of Kevin Bacon.” In all seriousness, Stumped aims to connect the classroom in a multitude of ways so that you feel as much a part of your academic community as you would like.</p>

<p>In the end, Stumped’s goal is to remind you that college is not something that should be done alone. Everyday you walk into a classroom with tens or hundreds of living, breathing, thinking resources that can help you learn more effectively and efficiently. We want to help you do just that. Through Stumped’s platform, we believe we can improve your academic experience by solving problems every student faces. Become a part of your academic community; feel its pulse. Connect, collaborate and carry on.</p>
